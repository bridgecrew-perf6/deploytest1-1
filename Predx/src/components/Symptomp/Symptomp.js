 '"My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. \r\nWe have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective."',
 '"I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\r\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas."',
 '"This is my first time using any form of birth control. I&#039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch"',
 '"Suboxone has completely turned my life around.  I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin."',
 '"2nd day on 5mg started to work with rock hard erections however experianced headache, lower bowel preassure. 3rd day erections would wake me up &amp; hurt! Leg/ankles aches   severe lower bowel preassure like you need to go #2 but can&#039;t! Enjoyed the initial rockhard erections but not at these side effects or $230 for months supply! I&#039;m 50 &amp; work out 3Xs a week. Not worth side effects!","My husband (age 63) has been having problems with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia, and erectile dysfunction as well.  We had gone from a fantastic sex life to one that was fading fast.  Then his doctor put him on a small daily dose (5 mg) of Cialis. Holy smokes!  He is bigger and harder than he was at 30. I am loving this. I have always had a powerful sex drive, and I was resigning myself to watching that fade away. I&#039;m now clearing my schedule for action. I am honestly feeling more satisfied than I did at 25.  Ladies, if your guy is slowing down, push him to do this.  You may not have as much time to clean the house, but both of you will be smiling a lot more!"',
 '"He pulled out, but he cummed a bit in me. I took the Plan B 26 hours later, and took a pregnancy test two weeks later - - I&#039;m pregnant.","I had the Mirena put in almost a year ago. Insertion was a breeze next to no cramping. My periods have remained heavy and do not show signs of stopping. Have gained about 30 pounds have acne and headaches and backache, so now I am wondering what is next. My doctor would not take it out and wanted me to remain on it for a year. It is almost a year so I am finding a new doctor and getting it taken out.","My time with skyla has been an absolute breeze. Ms. Skyla and i have been together since late october 2015 and it has been great. I must admit that the insertion is a bit painful,but you will soon forget. I got cramps for about a weekafter insertion. Nothing that a littlw ibuprofen couldnt tackle. I urge anyone who is thinking about skyla to just do it. I promise it is worth it. Please remember that pain is subjective. Meaning it just depends on the person. ","I&#039;m 27 w/ two kids. After my second child was born in 2008 I suffered from almost daily tension/migraine headaches. I wanted to try Mirena as a solution to birth control and possibly help my headaches. After 4 months my headaches are slightly better but I have had some noticeable side effects; 10-15 lbs weight gain, increased discharge, longer periods, and cramping after sex or exercise. ","Had the Liletta inserted in November. The process overall wasn&#039;t bad, but I also had numbing injections which helped so much with the pain. Just a couple cramps and it was over. Stopped having a period after three months, and the weird cramps I kept feeling stopped around 5 months. Everything was great until I noticed my clothes weren&#039;t fitting anymore. I&#039;ve gained 10 - 12 pounds despite months of a very clean diet, counting calories, and frequent exercise. I also started losing my hair a few weeks ago, and began sprouting chin hair that I didn&#039;t have before, which is making me feel very depressed. I am beyond frustrated and am having it removed in a few days.","I am 25 yrs old, no kids and have never been pregnant. After almost 10 years of being on the pill, my doctor and I decided it was time for some thing different. Insertion was very painful, the first one we were trying was faulty so I had to purchase another one right after to be placed. It was extremely uncomfortable, even after being advised to take 800mg of Motrin! I had my boyfriend bring me to and from the doctor, which I would recommend. After I got home I placed a heating pad on my lower abdomen and slept for about 2 hrs! After I woke up I felt like a completely different person! I had no aches or pains, back to normal! I would highly recommend this to any woman, there&#039;s no more remembering! I love it!"',
 '"Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.","Abilify 20 mg.\r\nI am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&#039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&#039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.\r\nAbilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. \r\nMy thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  \r\nI don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.","Intake Effexor XR 375 mg, and lorazepam for depression and anxiety. My doctor added Abilify and I took it in mornings. It made me foggy. I moved it to Bertie and sleep better overall. I have noticed an increase in irritability which equates to feeling extremely angry by 3 pm daily. I&#039;ve rearranged my lorazepam to reduce that but need more time. I&#039;m also having restlessness which almost feels manic. We shall see. Increased cravings for sweets."',
 '" I Ve had  nothing but problems with the Keppera : constant shaking in my arms &amp; legs &amp; pins &amp; needles feeling in my arms &amp; legs severe light headedness no appetite &amp; etc.","It works very well"',
 '"I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&#039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&#039;ll be just like when I was younger.","I love Lutera. I am very sensitive to other forms of birth control. Lutera has been one of the only kinds I can take. \r\r\nPros: light periods, no cramping, no intense side effects, bigger boobs.\r\r\nCons: Brown periods, slight weight gain. \r\r\nI also tend to get a bit emotional 1 or 2 days before my period....however I am always an emotional person so this could just be me. I have been on Lutera for 6 years ☺","I&#039;ve been on Jolessa for 6 months.  I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period (even though they&#039;d only last 3 days, 4 days at most) and I wanted to avoid it altogether.  The first two months, it was great.  Then my period arrived a month early and the bleeding lasted for 25 days, mostly light.  I had already picked up my next 90 day pack so I figured I&#039;d try to get through that and if I still had the bleeding, I&#039;d talk to my doctor about another birth control.  No need to do that because Jolessa is now working perfectly for me.  It&#039;s been wonderful not having a period for a few months.  I&#039;d recommend this birth control to anyone."',
 '"I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can.  Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&#039;m sure it would not have been safe.

 '"Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework.

It&#039;s simply not worth the hassle","I have been on this for 8 months and sad to say it&#039;s caused nothing but my self esteem to become lower. I&#039;ve gained 10 lbs out of no where. I&#039;m only 22 and have a fast metabolism. I thought it started to slow down but it didn&#039;t make sense. My breasts got smaller, I have lost complete sex drive, my breasts aren&#039;t sensitive anymore at all like they used to be and I&#039;m so emotional, even crying at times. The only thing I can say is that it is 100% effective but not worth what it has done to my body. Not only that but I started breaking out on my body and on my face as well."',
 '"Was on this med for 5 years. Worked fine but not great. Stopped the panic attacks and gave me relief of every day nervousness that I was experiencing. Took months for the side effects to diminish when I first started taking it. What did not leave - insomnia, night sweats, lack of sex drive and poor orgasms (or no orgasms at all).","This medicine saved my life. I was at my wits end with anti-depressants and was ready to give up. My doctor finally prescribed me this after many failed medications, I am so glad she did. I honestly do not know where I would be without Effexor XR. Side effects were very mild compared to other anti-depressants I tried. I was drowsy for the first couple days, but it was tolerable. I highly recommend this for severe depression. I would also like to mention for people to realize there is light at the end of the tunnel and YOU WILL GET BETTER, and to never give up."',
 '"I was put on Yasmin for 6 months to regulate my cycle and reduce acne flare-ups and it was the worst 6 months of my life. I gained 20lbs that did NOT come off easily after stopping the pill, experienced horrible mood swings, had HEAVIER periods, acne breakouts, breakthrough bleeding, and I was nauseous all the time. This pill seems to agree with most people but it definitely did not agree with me. I went on Femcon a year after stopping Yasmin and experienced virtually no side effects."',
 '"I was off birth control for a while considering getting pregnant. I had used other types of birth control before, the pill, the patch, etc. I decided to get back on birth control but didn&#039;t want to worry about taking a daily pill so I requested the Nuvaring. When I started the Nuvaring I felt it inside my body and had a lot of cramps. A few days later I started experiencing more cramps and very strong upper stomach pain. They were so bad I missed work for a week. Finally I ended up going to the ER and they couldn&#039;t figure out what was wrong. I finally asked the doctor and it was the Nuvaring side effects.","I have been on pills for years, and in 2012 I tried Mirena. I had cramps and terrible side effects all the time and just had it taken out last month because I have gained around 10lbs in my stomach area. I have been on Nuvaring for about 2 weeks and so far it&#039;s way better. As soon as Mirena was removed my weird stomach pains stopped, but I&#039;m still trying to lose the extra weight. \r\n\r\n","I am torn by the Nuvaring. The convenience is great. There is no daily time to take a pill, only once a month which can easily be marked on a calender or put into a phone. It never falls out, I never feel it and changing it is simple, too. I would give the Nuvaring a 10 out of 10 just based upon the simplicity and the price is really reasonable, too. But, there are some downsides (for me personally). For the first few months, I did not notice side effects, although they are there. I have a VERY low tolerance to alcohol when on the Nuvaring. Very emotional, tired, and strung out all the time. I was on the pill before and none of these happened. I also have longer periods. It&#039;s worth a try, every girl seems to have a different experience!"',
 '"I took the Prepopik for my first colonoscopy (I&#039;m 25) and I found it to be very effective. The orange flavor was very tolerable. I had no bad cramps or terrible side effects with it, but I had taken magnesium citrate the night before and that had already cleaned me out somewhat. My only issue was I ended up so dehydrated that I showed up to my colonoscopy with a fever. Try to drink as much fluid as you can with this prep! I drank plenty, but there was more liquid coming out of me than going in. Overall, I would recommend the Prepopik. On a side note, my insurance didn&#039;t cover it, but the office I go to had it available. I recommend asking your office if they have it available if insurance won&#039;t cover it at the pharmacy."',
 '"I just hit my three month point on tretinoin .05% and I&#039;m so happy. I was really  depressed about my skin during the first two months because I&#039;ve never had bad acne and the cream made me have horrible acne. But I knew that was the worst part of it and after that was over I would be fine. I&#039;ve inly had two zits since then and I&#039;m only left with scars which is fine. Try it out even if you&#039;re scared because I was too and I&#039;m so glad i did. It&#039;s worth it!"',

 '"Best treatment for acne I have used! I&#039;ve gone through accutane, many face washes, retinol creams, and other forms of birth control. Some other forms of birth control just make acne worse, depending on the type of progestin in it. You need the least androgenic type possible, and sprintec has worked the best for me! Nearly clear skin. Takes about 5-6 months to fully work, but it does work.","I wrote my expirence with this pill before, back when I started and it actually worked.\r\r\n\r\r\nI&#039;ve been on it for 6 months now and let me tell you, i&#039;m already going to the doctor to switch. \r\r\nSure, no babies.

I never have any motivation, i burst out crying for no reasons, and I get angry out of no where. This is very out of character for me. \r\r\nI&#039;m disapointed but hopefully I will find a better option.","I don&#039;t think I noticed this at first or even realized the pill was the cause, but this pill gave me terrible headaches for 3-4 days during my period.  I am hungry and moody before my period. The period is very light, which is a plus, but I can&#039;t stand the headaches.  It feels like I have a sinus infection and taking Advil non stop doesn&#039;t help.  It&#039;s not worth it.  I would LOVE to have cramps instead of headaches."',

 '"I took Clomid for the first time last month. My husband and I tried for a year. I have a blocked Fallopian tube. I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I&#039;m pregnant! So Clomid worked great for me so far. Yay!"',

 '"Drinking a few extra 16oz bottles of water during the period after taking the Milk of Magnesia will help stop the painful hard stools constipation usually brings. It will help ease the release. There can be different amount of time you can expect the recommended dosage to work. For me it&#039;s best taken on an empty stomach. No food for 4 hours or more helps speed the desired effect. If it&#039;s been several days since you normally have movements it will also take longer for the effects to begin. Drink water, as much as you possibly can. If diarrhea occurs cut back on water. Take the prescribed dose, not more. Drinking lots of water along with sufficient fiber in my diet has become much easier than fighting with constant constipation."',

The vaginal insert of the cream wasn&#039;t bad until it melts....and then it gets itchy inside your lady cave so to speak. After the first hour it seemed to calm down a lot!

I will say in the beginning my side effects were awful I always felt tired but I pushed passed that and it went away. I have since gone off my blood pressure medicine as well. I would recommend following closely with your doctor if you are on BP meds though because my blood pressure dropped so quick I was fainting. Not from Qsymia but from getting healthy so fast.","I have been on the Qysmia for 3 weeks now.  I wanted  to wait a few weeks  to give a review.

The  medication  if not covered  or with the free trial  is expensive.  So be prepared.  I guess it  is cheaper  than weight loss surgery.  But it&#039;s no magic pill neither.

It took me a couple of years to figure out why I&#039;d become this hyperemotional person, but then after much research, realized it was the Aviane. I began to pay attention to my moods and regulate my mood swings, which helped. I&#039;ve been off the pill for over a year now, but if I had to go back on birth control, I would choose this one again."',
 '"I&#039;ve been on this medication almost a full month. I never feel hungry and have been eating WAY less than I ever have, however the scale has not moved. Bad heartburn has been my only side effect. I&#039;ll try it one more month and then if no weight loss, I&#039;m going to stop. Disappointed...and I had to pay $1,000 out of pocket!"',
 '"This med caused me to hear internal voices (auditory hallucinations, but in my head). Made me paranoid, anxious, scared to be alone, tired, nauseated, no appetite,  and felt schizophrenic.

 '"Depo has been great for relief of pain from endometriosis. I am on my 3rd shot. No more period, but I do spot the whole month before the next shot is due. I am hoping that will stop as my body gets used to it more. The shot is painless, the only side effect I have noticed is minor weight gain and my sex drive has decreased a bit. I am okay with that at least the pain is gone. I got scared reading what everyone had to say about this drug and almost didn&#039;t get it. I am glad I took the chance to see how &quot;I&quot; reacted to it. Everyone is different. I am very satisfied with it."',
 '"I am female in her early 30&#039;s - about 3 years ago I developed adult acne after years of relatively clear skin. Benzyol peroxide had been my miracle acne product but then I developed contact dermatitis and could no longer use it :( I honestly could not go more than a day without a new pimple developing despite using other prescription acne grade products, vitamin A as well as expensive spa treatments. I have been on Aczone about a month and have had instant results, I have not had a cystic pimple since. I still get blackheads and have milia on my chin/jawline but no pimples/whiteheads/cysts to speak of and have had no issues with dry skin. The product is pricey but I will save in the long run not wasting my money on others that don&#039;t work.","Hi, I&#039;ve been using this product over 3years and I&#039;m completely satisfied. My skin in super dry and It&#039;s really really working for me. While I&#039;m using this, my face is clear.

 '"I was prescribed Restasis by my ophthalmologist due to severe dry eye caused by Accutune. I was given a card that gave me a discount since I did not have private health insurance and used each vile over 2-3 days so that it became effectively very cheap for me to use. I had side effects at first, burning eyes and blurred vision. I was told it takes a minimum of 3 months to see any benefits so I kept using it. It worked almost too well, as my eyes started producing tears so much that my eyes would water all the time. I stopped using the product after 1 year, and my eyes have improved so much I no longer need to use it, although I still use regular over the counter eye drops (Systane Balance) once or twice a day as needed"',

 '"I started 5mg of olanzapine last night. I have not slept or felt calm in a couple months. I have dealt with Bipolar 1 and ADHD for many years. I went to my Psychiatrist and was told that for my condition I should not be on things like Celexa that I was taking at 40mg at night. Those serotonin medications can hype me up especially at night. So the only other medicine I take is Inderal LA 120mg for tremors I have from a neurological condition since childhood. I slept great last night for the first time in a long time. I also feel much more at ease in gathering my thoughts and focus. I just hope it continues and I do my part in staying stable too."',
 '"Great product I have been on other drugs that gave me back side effects-rash, itching, dry mouth, constipation, headache, dizziness, back pain, etc. I urinate on average 20-40 times a day every approx 15-20 minutes, after using the patch I went as long as 2 hours without using restroom. my skin is irritated and red but better than spending my whole day in the bathroom. I cant believe my doctor didn&#039;t put me on this over the counter drug first before spending hundreds of dollars on prescription medications. I have suffered for over 30 yrs with the issue of urgency and frequency this is a miracle for me.  Praise the LORD"',
 '"I was essentially mis-prescribed Actiq when I should have been getting fentanyl patches for my cancer pain.  This caused problems with both bolus dosing (transient overdosage) and build-up of opioid tolerance with the Actiq that have not been nearly as great a problem with fentanyl patches.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther patients may have different experiences; however for chronic cancer pain, the patches might be considered before use of Actiq."',
 '"My experience with this product is a lot different from everyone else&#039;s. I have never had a really really bad acne just a few spots here and there so when I went to see the dermatologist they prescribed me this gel to put on every night over my whole face. Firstly everything was going fine I didn&#039;t see a difference and then after a week my skin had cleared up and it look flawless. However one night when I put my cream on and then waking up on the next morning my skin was literally burnt and my forehead was covered in those little spots which was terrible and they looked even worse with make up on because it was extremely bumpy. I stopped using the gel and it when away but was really bad.","Update:\r\r\nMy skin initially cleared up for the First week but then the next 2-3 weeks were horrible with a lot of breakouts!\r\r\nFor the first 3 weeks my skin was so red, painful, dry and peeling. Then all of a sudden everything went away...\r\r\nMy acne is minimal/almost completely gone after a little over a month and my skin feels so hydrated! Such a great product!"',
 '"When I was a 15 year old freshman in high school I broke out with severe acne. In literally one week my skin went from perfectly clear to large acne blotches on my cheeks, chin and neck that were painful to touch. After trying everything in the arsenal at the time (monocycline, benzaclIn, finacea, etc.) my dermatologist recommended Accutane. My only side effects were ridiculously chapped lips, dry skin on my face, and some joint pain. After a month and a half of treatment my acne was gone completely, and my skin clearer everyday thereafter. I was so depressed with the acne but this medicine changed my life for the better as I have never needed to use/take another acne medication following that 4 or 5 month treatment."',

 '"I&#039;m 31 &amp; have used many birth control options, beginning with the patch @ 19 then going to the pill within the year. My MD RX&#039;d me the loestrin 1/20 a year ago. This past year proved the best for me as far as overall health: fewer skin breakouts, MUCH lighter &amp; shorter periods (i frequently donate blood and am not iron-defficient anemic), better sex drive (husband loves), and moodiness not as bad. I have gained 7lb of weight but cannot pinpoint it directly to this pill as I have chosen a less healthy lifestyle the past year. The only negative about this pill for me was I did not stay on a 28 day cycle and had breakthrough bleeding. Today, MD changed me to loestrin 1.5/30 for this reason."',

 '"I am 29 and just had my second Mirena inserted a few days ago. It was painful, but the pain only lasts for around 30 seconds if it goes smoothly.  I have seizures, and have chosen Mirena because it does not interact with my medicines. Other forms of birth control have caused more seizures. I do not have this problem with Mirena. It has not affected my skin (although I currently use medication for acne I&#039;ve had for years).  I like it because after it&#039;s inserted, I can forget about it for a few years.  The only thing I&#039;ve found inconvenient, is having a partner be able to feel the strings.  BUT my gyno said most men are not even aware.  ","I love my Mirena. I&#039;m due in February to take it out because my 5 years are up. It did not bother me at all to get it inserted. It was pretty easy, I had minor cramps after. I got it because I had gotten pregnant at 16 and had my daughter at 17. I got it because I knew my boyfriend and I were not ready for another child. On top of that from the moment I got my period it was hell. I got my period a month after insertion and ever since then it&#039;s been a smooth ride. I haven&#039;t had a period since and definitely have not gotten pregnant again. I guess its true when they say everybody takes differently to it. So come February I plan on getting it again for another 5 years. I&#039;m one happy customer."',
 '"This is absolutely the best birth control I have ever used. I switched from Nexplanon to Ortho Evra, and if you are thinking of doing the same, I highly recommend it.  Let me list the reasons why:\r\n1. Weight loss. I have lost 5lbs in one month, without even trying!  I&#039;m back to the weight I was before I started birth control...but my breasts are still birth control sized.\r\n2. Sex drive. Mine had been non-existent since I went on Nexplanon in September. Now, stronger than ever. That might be a downside though, now that I think about it.\r\n3. Skin- no acne!\r\n4. Predictable cycle. (On Nexplanon, I never knew when I was going to menstruate, which was about 90% of the time). Now, a non issue.\r\n5. Don&#039;t have to remember everyday."',
 '"I&#039;ve received spinal injections because after a serious car accident I&#039;ve been left with severe pain and will do anything to relieve it. Anytime I get an injection, they give me propofol before the injection and I&#039;m knocked out within a few seconds and then awake a few minutes after the procedure.

 '"My Endo insisted I switch from lantus to tresiba.  I was quite stable on lantus and humalog for over 15 years but she said it was better.  I&#039;ve been a diabetic for almost 30 years and so I was very hesitant to switch.  I should have listened to myself.  The first 3 weeks were okay but not better.  Then I started feeling breathless and fatigued.  It took me awhile\u200b to realize it was the tresiba.  I switched back to lantus a week ago and I am already feeling better.  No more breathlessness or fatigue.  My blood sugars were worse on tresiba so it will take a bit to straighten out my a1c.  I really should have listened to my gut.  Just because it&#039;s new doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s better."',
 '"This drug causes persistent nausea in some users as per their website. For most people it goes away after a few weeks--but not all. Initially I was also itchy and a little weepy (went away after 2 weeks). If you have a history of being unusually nausea prone (ie pregnancy) in my experience you may wind up in the persistent nausea group. I will have to switch as I don&#039;t want to be chained to zofran. Otherwise, worked fine as an alternative to paxil. Fewer side effects--unfortunately the one side effect it did cause is pretty debilitating in my case!"',
 '"I&#039;ve only had one dose of Lupron; before going on it I did my research. One side effect is HORRIBLE insomnia (which I have). I know not every single change in my body can be blamed on the Lupron. I have Endometriosis and the Lupron basically puts you in a state of menopause. Headaches, insomnia, sweats, mood swings were very bad the first couple of weeks; now my stomach hurts! So I think I can pick and choose what the medicine is responsible for and the state of chemical menopause is doing to me."',

I missed a period last month and immediately went to the dr to make sure everything was okay. He confirmed it was probably stress due to the numerous issues I listed and prescribed provera 10mg once a day for 10 days. He said this would make me have a period after the 10 days so that my next period wouldn&#039;t be so bad. Day 1 didn&#039;t sleep for 27 hours. Day 2 I got extremely weak but couldn&#039;t sleep at all and the cramps started rapidly. Day 3 I&#039;m in tears from all the pain and pressure in my lower stomach and back.

I go for my next scan in a few weeks. I&#039;m so fortunate in that I&#039;ve had no side effects. Your neutrophils will dip and yes, I&#039;m tired at times but what else is new. I know that some are experiencing terrible side effects but I wanted to chime in and say that not everyone experiences them. I do take spirulina pills and they seem to help get my neutrophils where they should be (above 1.0). If you are a candidate for ibrance, count yourself lucky and try it!"',

The doctor tried a diuretic which did nothing, and then a beta blocker which had horrible side effects. They finally tried 10mg of lisinopril and wow how great! It almost immediately brought my blood pressure to 118/80&#039;s. I actually cut my dose to 2.5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg at lunch and my blood pressure stays perfect all day and night.

This morning, woke up in withdrawal, cold, nausea, abdominal cramps, horrible pain and feeling lousy. Odd as my last pain med dose was six hours before, and I do not get withdrawals that quickly. My morning pain meds fixed withdrawals but was still in significant pain until 1pm after second pain med dose at 12. Seems to decrease pain reducing effects of opiods."',
