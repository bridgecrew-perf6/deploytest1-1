My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle.

I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.\\r\\nAbilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.

I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. \\r\\nMy thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  \\r\\nI don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.

In literally one week my skin went from perfectly clear to large acne blotches on my cheeks, chin and neck that were painful to touch. After trying everything in the arsenal at the time (monocycline, benzaclIn, finacea, etc.) my dermatologist recommended Accutane. My only side effects were ridiculously chapped lips, dry skin on my face, and some joint pain. After a month and a half of treatment my acne was gone completely, and my skin clearer everyday thereafter. I was so depressed with the acne but this medicine changed my life for the better as I have never needed to use/take another acne medication following that 4 or 5 month treatment.\"',\n '\"2mg of xanax works perfectly for my panic attack when i feel one coming on i take one 2mg pill and it takes it away and i am no longer being run by my panic attack.\"',\n '\"This medication is amazing!

I have gained 7lb of weight but cannot pinpoint it directly to this pill as I have chosen a less healthy lifestyle the past year.

It was painful, but the pain only lasts for around 30 seconds if it goes smoothly.  I have seizures, and have chosen Mirena because it does not interact with my medicines. Other forms of birth control have caused more seizures. I do not have this problem with Mirena. It has not affected my skin (although I currently use medication for acne I&#039;ve had for years).  I like it because after it&#039;s inserted, I can forget about it for a few years.  The only thing I&#039;ve found inconvenient, is having a partner be able to feel the strings.

On top of that from the moment I got my period it was hell. I got my period a month after insertion and ever since then it&#039;s been a smooth ride.
